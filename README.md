# MJLLogger

A logging framework for swift. There are a lot of them out there, but I didn't find one that:

* Works on Linux, maOS, iOS
* Allows categorization
* Allows changing logging config while running (so you don't have to restart a server)

Also works as a backend for [swift-log](https://github.com/apple/swift-log).
